## About The Project

![FlarumES](https://flarumes.com/assets/site-image-bfqb2dxn.png)

Spanish language pack for Flarum Software, includes its extensions and libraries in two Spanish language registers: Formal Spanish and Informal Spanish, both selectable from the extension administrator dashboard.

This extension is maintained by members of the verified Flarum en Español community.

### Minimum Requirements
